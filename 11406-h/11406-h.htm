      SPIRIT OF THE "ANNUALS," FOR 1829.
    </h3>
    <p>
      For some days past our table has been glittering with these
      caskets of song and tale in their gay attire of silken sheen
      and burnished gold&mdash;till their splendour has fairly put
      out the light of our <i>sinumbra</i>, and the drabs, blues,
      and yellows of sober, business-like quartos and octavos.
      Seven out of nine of these elegant little books are in
      "watered" silk bindings; and an ingenious lady-friend has
      favoured us with the calculation that the silk used in
      covering the presumed number sold (70,000) would extend five
      miles, or from Hyde Park Corner to Turnham Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brilliant as may be their exteriors, their contents are, as
      Miss Jane Porter says of her heroines, "transcendently
      beautiful." But of these we shall present our readers with
      some exquisite specimens. Our only trouble in this task is
      the <i>embarras du richesses</i> with which we are
      surrounded; otherwise it is to us an exhaustless source of
      delight, especially when we consider the "gentle feelings and
      affections" which this annual distribution will cherish, and
      the innumerable intertwinings of hands and hearts which this
      shower of <i>bon-bons</i> will produce; and such warm friends
      are we to this social scheme, that our presentation
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>[pg
      306]</span> copies are already in the fair hands whither we
      had destined them.

      The Forget-Me-Not.

      <i>Edited by Frederic Shoberl</i>, Esq.

    <p>
      The present volume, in its graphic and literary attractions
      is decidedly superior to that of last year, an improvement
      which makes us credit what the Ettrick Shepherd says of the
      proprietor&mdash;"There's no a mair just, nay, generous man
      in his dealings wi' his authors, in a' the tredd, than Mr.
      Ackermann."

    <p>
      This beautiful Annual contains the original of our ENGRAVING,
      from a plate by A. Freebairn, after an admirable picture by
      S. Prout, of which the following story is
      illustrative:&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE MAGICIAN OF VICENZA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the year 1796, on one of the finest evenings of an Italian
      autumn, when the whole population of the handsome city of
      Vicenza were pouring into the streets to enjoy the fresh air,
      that comes so deliciously along the currents of its three
      rivers; when the Campo Marzo was crowded with the opulent
      citizens and Venetian nobles; and the whole ascent, from the
      gates to the Madonna who sits enthroned on the summit of
      Monte Berrico, was a line of the gayest pilgrims that ever
      wandered up the vine-covered side of an Alpine hill; the ears
      of all were caught by the sound of successive explosions from
      a boat running down the bright waters of the Bachiglione.
      Vicenza was at peace, under the wing of the lion of St. Mark,
      but the French were lying round the ramparts of Mantua. They
      had not yet moved on Venice; yet her troops were known to be
      without arms, experience, or a general, and the sound of a
      cracker would have startled her whole dominions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat itself was of a singular make; and the rapidity with
      which this little chaloupe, glittering with gilding and hung
      with streamers, made its way along the sparkling stream,
      struck the observers as something extraordinary. It flew by
      every thing on the river, yet no one was visible on board. It
      had no sail up, no steersman, no rower; yet it plunged and
      rushed along with the swiftness of a bird. The Vicentine
      populace are behind none of their brethren in superstition,
      and at the sight of the flying chaloupe, the groups came
      running from the Campo Marzo. The Monte Berrico was speedily
      left without a pilgrim, and the banks of the Bachiglione
      were, for the first time since the creation, honoured with
      the presence of the Venetian authorities, and even of the
      sublime podesta [the governor, a Venetian noble.] himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was fortunate for them that the flying phenomenon had
      reached the open space formed by the conflux of the three
      rivers, before the crowd became excessive; for, just as it
      had darted out from the narrow channel, lined on both sides
      with the whole thirty thousand old, middle-aged, and young,
      men, maids, and matrons of the city, a thick smoke was seen
      rising from its poop, its frame quivered, and, with a
      tremendous explosion, the chaloupe rose into the air in ten
      thousand fragments of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The multitude were seized with consternation; and the whole
      fell on their knees, from the sublime podesta himself, to the
      humblest saffron-gatherer. Never was there such a mixture of
      devotion. Never was there such a concert of exclamations,
      sighs, callings on the saints, and rattling of beads. The
      whole concourse lay for some minutes with their very noses
      rubbing to the ground, until they were all roused at once by
      a loud burst of laughter. Thirty thousand pair of eyes were
      lifted up at the instant, and all fixed in astonishment on a
      human figure, seen calmly sitting on the water, in the very
      track of the explosion, and still half hidden in the heavy
      mass of smoke that curled in a huge globe over the remnants.
      The laugh had proceeded from him, and the nearer he
      approached the multitude, the louder he laughed. At length,
      stopping in front of the spot where the sublime podesta, a
      little ashamed of his prostration, was getting the dust
      shaken out of his gold-embroidered robe of office, and
      bathing his burning visage in orange-flower water, the
      stranger began a sort of complimentary song to the famous
      city of Vicenza.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger found a willing audience; for his first stanza
      was in honour of the "most magnificent city of Vicenza;" its
      "twenty palaces by the matchless Palladio;" much more "its
      sixty churches;" and much more than all "its breed of
      Dominicans, unrivalled throughout the earth for the fervour
      of their piety and the capacity of their stomachs." The last
      touch made the grand-prior of the cathedral wince a little,
      but it was welcomed with a roar from the multitude. The song
      proceeded; but if the prior had frowned at the first stanza,
      the podesta was doubly angry at the second, which sneered at
      Venetian pomposity in incomparable style. But the prior and
      podesta were equally outvoted, for the roar of the multitude
      was twice as loud as before. Then came other touches on the
      <i>cavalieri serventi</i>, the ladies, the
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name="page307"></a>[pg
      307]</span> nuns, and the husbands, till every class had its
      share: but the satire was so witty, that, keen as it was, the
      shouts of the people silenced all disapprobation. He finished
      by a brilliant stanza, in which he said, that "having been
      sent by Neptune from the depths of the ocean to visit the
      earth, he had chosen for his landing-place its most renowned
      spot, the birthplace of the gayest men and the handsomest
      women&mdash;the exquisite Vicenza." With these words he
      ascended from the shore, and was received with thunders of
      applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      His figure was tall and elegant. He wore a loose, scarlet
      cloak thrown over his fine limbs, Greek sandals, and a cap
      like that of the Italian princes of three centuries before, a
      kind of low circle of green and vermilion striped silk,
      clasped by a large rose of topaz. The men universally said,
      that there was an atrocious expression in his countenance;
      but the women, the true judges after all, said, without
      exception, that this was envy in the men, and that the
      stranger was the most "delightful looking <i>Diavolo</i>"
      they had ever set eyes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger, on his landing, desired to be led to the
      principal hotel; but he had not gone a dozen steps from the
      water-side, when he exclaimed that he had lost his purse.
      Such an imputation was never heard before in an Italian city;
      at least so swore the multitude; and the stranger was on the
      point of falling several fathoms deep in his popularity. But
      he answered the murmur by a laugh; and stopping in front of a
      beggar, who lay at the corner of an hospital roaring out for
      alms, demanded the instant loan of fifty sequins. The beggar
      lifted up his hands and eyes in speechless wonder, and then
      shook out his rags, which, whatever else they might show,
      certainly showed no sequins, "The sequins, or death!" was the
      demand, in a tremendous voice. The beggar fell on the ground
      convulsed, and from his withered hand, which every one had
      seen empty the moment before, out flew fifty sequins, bright
      as if they had come that moment from St. Mark's mint. The
      stranger took them from the ground, and, with a smile, flung
      them up in a golden shower through the crowd. The shouts were
      immense, and the mob insisted on carrying him to the door of
      his hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Venetian vigilance was by this time a little
      awakened, and a patrol of the troops was ordered to bring
      this singular stranger before the sublime podesta. The crowd
      instantly dropped him at the sight of the bayonets, and
      knowing the value of life in the most delicious climate of
      the world, took to their heels. The guard took possession of
      their prisoner, and were leading him rather roughly to the
      governor's house, when he requested them to stop for a moment
      beside a convent gate, that he might get a cup of wine. But
      the Dominicans would not give the satirist of their
      illustrious order a cup of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will not give me refreshment," exclaimed he, in an
      angry tone, "give me wherewithal to buy it. I demand a
      hundred sequins."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prior himself was at the window above his head; and the
      only answer was a sneer, which was loyally echoed through
      every cloister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me have your bayonet for a moment," said the stranger to
      one of his guard. He received it; and striking away a
      projecting stone in the wall, out rushed the hundred sequins.
      The prior clasped his hands in agony, that so much money
      should have been so near, and yet have escaped his pious
      purposes, The soldiers took off their caps for the
      discoverer, and bowed them still lower when he threw every
      sequin of it into the shakos of those polite warriors. The
      officer, to whom he had given a double share, showed his
      gratitude by a whisper, offering to assist his escape for as
      much more. But the stranger declined the civility, and walked
      boldly into the presence-chamber of the sublime podesta.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Signer Dominico Castello-Grande Tremamondo was a little
      Venetian noble, descended in a right line from Aeneas, with a
      palazzo on the Canale Regio of Venice, which he let for a
      coffee-house; and living in the pomp and pride of a
      <i>magnifico</i> on something more than the wages of an
      English groom. The intelligence of this extraordinary
      stranger's discoveries had flown like a spark through a
      magazine, and the <i>illustrissimo</i> longed to be a
      partaker in the secret. He interrogated the prisoner with
      official fierceness, but could obtain no other reply than the
      general declaration, that he was a traveller come to see the
      captivations of Italy. In the course of the inquiry the
      podesta dropped a significant hint about money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to money," was the reply, "I seldom carry any about me;
      it is so likely to tempt <i>rascals</i> to dip deeper in
      roguery. I have it whenever I choose to call for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see the experiment made, merely for its
      curiosity," said the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall be obeyed," was the answer; "but I never ask for
      more than a sum for present expenses. Here, you
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>[pg
      308]</span> fellow!" said he, turning to one of the
      half-naked soldiery, "lend me five hundred sequins!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole guard burst into laughter. The sum would have been
      a severe demand on the military chest of the army. The
      handsome stranger advanced to him, and, seizing his musket,
      said, loftily, "Fellow, if you won't give the money, this
      must." He struck the butt-end of the musket thrice upon the
      floor. At the third blow a burst of gold poured out, and
      sequins ran in every direction. The soldiery and the officers
      of the court were in utter astonishment. All wondered, many
      began to cross themselves, and several of the most celebrated
      swearers in the regiment dropped upon their knees. But their
      devotions were not long, for the sublime podesta ordered the
      hall to be cleared, and himself, the stranger, and the
      sequins, left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days nothing more was heard of any of the three,
      and the Vicenzese scarcely ate, drank, or slept, through
      anxiety to know what was become of the man in the scarlet
      cloak, and cap striped green and vermilion. Jealousy,
      politics, and piety, at length put their heads together, and,
      by the evening of the third day, the <i>cavalieri</i> had
      agreed that he was some rambling actor, or Alpine thief, the
      statesmen, that he was a spy; and the Dominicans that he was
      Satan in person. The women, partly through the contradiction
      natural to the lovely sex, and partly through the novelty of
      not having the world in their own way, were silent; a
      phenomenon which the Italian philosophers still consider the
      true wonder of the whole affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the third day a new Venetian governor, with
      a stately <i>cortege</i>, was seen entering at the Water
      Gate, full gallop, from Venice: he drove straight to the
      podesta's house, and, after an audience, was provided with
      apartments in the town-house, one of the finest in Italy, and
      looking out upon the <i>Piazza Grande</i>, in which are the
      two famous columns, one then surmounted by the winged lion of
      St. Mark, as the other still is by a statue of the founder of
      our faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was furiously stormy, and the torrents of rain and
      perpetual roaring of the thunder drove the people out of the
      streets. But between the tempest and curiosity not an eye was
      closed that night in the city. Towards morning the tempest
      lulled, and in the intervals of the wind, strange sounds were
      heard, like the rushing of horses and rattling of carriages.
      At length the sounds grew so loud that curiosity could be
      restrained no longer, and the crowd gathered towards the
      entrance of the <i>Piazza</i>. The night was dark beyond
      description, and the first knowledge of the hazard that they
      were incurring was communicated to the shivering mob by the
      kicks of several platoons of French soldiery, who let them
      pass within their lines, but prohibited escape. The square
      was filled with cavalry, escorting wagons loaded with the
      archives, plate, and pictures, of the government. The old
      podesta was seen entering a carriage, into which his very
      handsome daughter, the betrothed of the proudest of the proud
      Venetian senators, was handed by the stranger. The procession
      then moved, and last, and most surprising of all, the
      stranger, mounting a charger, put himself at the head of the
      cavalry, and, making a profound adieu to the new governor,
      who stood shivering at the window in care of a file of
      grenadiers, dashed forward on the road to Milan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day rose, and the multitude rushed out to see what was become
      of the city. Every thing was as it had been, but the column
      of the lion: its famous emblem of the Venetian republic was
      gone, wings and all. They exclaimed that the world had come
      to an end. But the wheel of fortune is round, let politicians
      say what they will. In twelve months from that day the old
      podesta was again sitting in the government-house&mdash;yet a
      podesta no more, but a French prefect; the Signora Maria, his
      lovely daughter, was sitting beside him, with an infant, the
      image of her own beauty, and beside her the stranger, no
      longer the man of magic in the scarlet cloak and green and
      vermilion striped cap with a topaz clasp, but a French
      general of division, in blue and silver, her husband, as
      handsome as ever, and, if not altogether a professed
      <i>Diavolo</i>, quite as successful in finding money whenever
      he wanted it. His first <i>entree</i> into Vicenza had been a
      little theatrical, for such is the genius of his country. The
      blowing-up of his little steam-boat, which had nearly
      furnished his drama with a tragic catastrophe, added to its
      effect; and his discovery of the sequins was managed by three
      of his countrymen. As an inquirer into the nakedness of the
      land, he might have been shot as a spy. As half-charlatan and
      half-madman, he was sure of national sympathy. During the
      three days of his stay the old podesta had found himself
      accessible to reason, the podesta's daughter to the tender
      passion, and the treasures of the state to the locomotive
      skill of the French detachment, that waited in the mountains
      the result of their officer's
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>[pg
      309]</span> diplomacy. The lion of St. Mark, having nothing
      else to do, probably disdained to remain, and in the same
      night took wing from the column, to which he has never
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we love to "march in good order," we begin with the
      plates, the most striking of which is the Frontispiece,
      <i>Marcus Curtius</i>, by Le Keux, from a design by Martin,
      which we are at a loss to describe. It requires a microscopic
      eye to fully appreciate all its beauties&mdash;yet the
      thousands of figures and the architectural background, are so
      clear and intelligible as to make our optic nerve sympathize
      with the labour of the artist. The next is a <i>View on the
      Ganges</i>, by Finden, after Daniell; <i>Constancy</i>, by
      Portbury, after Stephanoff, in which the female figure is
      loveliness personified; <i>Eddystone during a Storm</i>; the
      <i>Proposal</i>, a beautiful family group; the <i>Cottage

      Piper</i>, from a painting by Clennell, who, from too great
      anxiety in the pursuit of his profession, was some years

          Langsyne!&mdash;how doth the word come back
        </p>
        <p>
          With magic meaning to the heart,
        </p>
        <p>
          As Memory roams the sunny track,
        </p>
        <p>
          From which Hope's dreams were loath to part!
        </p>
        <p>
          No joy like by-past joy appears;
        </p>
        <p>
          For what is gone we peak and pine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Were life spun out a thousand years,
        </p>
        <p>
          It could not match Langsyne!

      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          Langsyne!&mdash;the days of childhood warm,
        </p>
        <p>
          When, tottering by a mother's knee,
        </p>
        <p>
          Each sight and sound had power to charm,
        </p>
        <p>
          And hope was high, and thought was free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Langsyne!&mdash;the merry schoolboy days&mdash;
        </p>
        <p>
          How sweetly then life's sun did shine!
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! for the glorious pranks and plays,
        </p>
        <p>
          The raptures of Langsyne!

          Langsyne!&mdash;yes, In the sound, I hear

        <p>
          The rustling of the summer grove,
        </p>
        <p>
          And view those angel features near,
        </p>
        <p>
          Which first awoke the heart to love.
        </p>
        <p>
          How sweet it is, in pensive mood,
        </p>
        <p>
          At windless midnight to recline,
        </p>
        <p>
          And fill the mental solitude
        </p>
        <p>

          With us its pleasures bright and blithe?
        </p>
        <p>
          Kindly with some hath fortune fared;
        </p>
        <p>
          And some have bowed beneath the scythe

        <p>
          Of death; while others, scattered far,

          O'er foreign lands at fate repine,
        </p>
        <p>
          Oft wandering forth, 'neath twilight's star,

          Ah, no! the rainbow hopes of youth.

          Farewell!&mdash;there can be no farewell

      Of the <i>prose</i> articles, we have already given some
      specimens&mdash;The Hour Too Many, a fortnight since; and
      Vicenza, just quoted. The next we notice is Recollections of
      Pere la Chaise, for the graphic accuracy of which we can
      answer; Eliza Carthago, an African anecdote, by Mrs.
      Bowditch; Terence O'Flaherty, a humorous story, by the Modern
      Pythagorean of Blackwood; two interesting stories of Modern
      Greece; a highly-wrought Persian Tale, by the late Henry
      Neele; Miss Mitford's charming Cricketing Sketch; the Maid of
      the Beryl, by Mrs. Hofland; a Chapter of Eastern Apologues,
      by the Ettrick Shepherd; the Goldsmith of Westcheap, a story
      of the olden time&mdash;rather too long; and a characteristic
      Naval Sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have already drawn somewhat freely on the present
      volume, we may adduce that as the best proof of the high
      opinion we entertain of its merits. The editor has only two
      or three pieces; but the excellent taste and judgment
      displayed in the editorship of the "Forget-me-not" entitle it
      to a foremost place among the "Annuals for 1829."

    <h2>
      The Literary Souvenir,
    </h2>
    <center>
      <i>Edited by Alaric A. Watts, Esq</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      If the present were the first volume of the Literary
      Souvenir, the name of the editor would be a passport to
      popularity; but as this is the fifth year of its publication,
      any recommendation of ours would be supererogatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Souvenir for 1829, realizes that delightful union of
      painting, engraving, and literature, (at whose beneficial
      influence we have glanced in our accompanying number) even
      more fully than its predecessors. Ten out of the twelve
      embellishments are from celebrated pictures, and the whole
      are by first-rate engravers. Of their cost we spoke cursorily
      in a recent number; so that we shall only particularize a few
      of the most striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engravings are of larger size than heretofore, and, for
      the most part, more brilliant in design and execution than
      any previous year. We can only notice <i>the Sisters</i>,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>[pg
      310]</span> (frontispiece) full of graceful and pleasing
      effect, by J.H. Robinson, after Stephanoff; <i>Cleopatra, on
      the Cydnus</i>, a splendid aquatic pageant, by E. Goodall,
      after Danby; the <i>Proposal</i>, consisting of two of the
      most striking figures in Leslie's exquisite painting of May
      Day in Queen Elizabeth's time; a <i>Portrait of Sir Walter
      Scott</i>, from Leslie's painting, and considered the best
      likeness; this is from the burin of an American artist of
      high promise. We must not, however, forget
      <i>Ehrenbreitstein, on the Rhine</i>, by John Pye, from a
      drawing by J.M.W. Turner, which is one of the most delightful
      prints in the whole series.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <i>poetry</i> are Cleopatra, well according with the
      splendid scene it is intended to illustrate&mdash;and I think
      of Thee, a tender lament&mdash;both by Mr. T.K. Hervey; Mrs.
      Hemans has contributed four exquisite pieces: Night, the Ship
      at Sea, and the Mariner's Grave, by Mr. John Malcolm, only
      make us regret that we have not room for either in our
      columns; Mary Queen of Scots, by H.G. Bell, Esq., is one of
      the most interesting historical ballads we have lately met
      with; the Epistle from Abbotsford, is a piece of pleasantry,
      which would have formed an excellent pendent to Sir Walter's
      Study, in our last; Zadig and Astarte, by Delta, are in the
      writer's most plaintive strain; the recollections of our
      happiest years, are harmoniously told in "Boyhood;" a ballad
      entitled "The Captive of Alhama," dated from Woburn Abbey,
      and signed R&mdash;&mdash;, is a soul-stirring production,
      attributed to Lord John Russel; and the Pixies of Devon has
      the masterly impress of the author of Dartmoor. And last in
      our enumeration, though first in our liking, are the
      following by the editor:&mdash;Invocation to the Echo of a
      Sea Shell; King Pedro's Revenge, with a well written
      historiette; the Youngling of the Flock, full of tenderness
      and parental affection; and some Stanzas, for our admiration
      of which we have not an epithet at hand, so we give the
      original.

      Barry Cornwall has contributed several minor pieces, though
      we fear his poetical reputation will not be increased by
      either of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the minor pieces are gems in their way, and one of
      the most beautiful will be found appended to our current
      Number.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the <i>prose</i>:&mdash;The first in the volume is "the
      Sisters," a pathetic tale of about thirty pages, which a
      little of the fashionable affectation of some literary
      coxcombs might fine-draw over a brace of small octavos. As it
      stands, the story is gracefully, yet energetically told, and
      is entitled to the place it occupies. The author of Pelham
      (<i>vide</i> the newspapers) has a pleasant conceit in the
      shape of a whole-length of fashion, which, being the best and
      shortest in its line that we have met with, will serve to
      enliven our extracts:&mdash;

    <h3>
      TOO HANDSOME FOR ANY THING!
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy was one of those models of perfection
      of which a human father and mother can produce
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>[pg
      311]</span> but a single example,&mdash;Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy
      was therefore an only son. He was such an amazing favourite
      with both his parents that they resolved to ruin him;
      accordingly, he was exceedingly spoiled, never annoyed by the
      sight of a book, and had as much plum-cake as he could eat.
      Happy would it have been for Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy could he
      always have eaten plum-cake, and remained a child. "Never,"
      says the Greek Tragedian, "reckon a mortal happy till you
      have witnessed his end." A most beautiful creature was Mr.
      Ferdinand Fitzroy! Such eyes&mdash;such hair&mdash;such
      teeth&mdash;such a figure&mdash;such manners, too,&mdash;and
      such an irresistible way of tying his neckcloth! When he was
      about sixteen, a crabbed old uncle represented to his parents
      the propriety of teaching Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy to read and
      write. Though not without some difficulty, he convinced
      them,&mdash;for he was exceedingly rich, and riches in an
      uncle are wonderful arguments respecting the nurture of a
      nephew whose parents have nothing to leave him. So our hero
      was sent to school. He was naturally (I am not joking now) a
      very sharp, clever boy; and he came on surprisingly in his
      learning. The schoolmaster's wife liked handsome
      children.&mdash;"What a genius will Master Ferdinand Fitzroy
      be, if you take pains with him!" said she, to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh, my dear, it is of no use to take pains with
      <i>him</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why, love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he is a great deal too handsome ever to be a
      scholar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that's true enough, my dear!" said the schoolmaster's
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, because he was too handsome to be a scholar, Mr.
      Ferdinand Fitzroy remained the lag of the fourth form!
    </p>
    <p>
      They took our hero from school.&mdash;"What profession shall
      he follow?" said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My first cousin is the Lord Chancellor," said his father,
      "let him go to the bar."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord Chancellor dined there that day: Mr. Ferdinand
      Fitzroy was introduced to him; his lordship was a little,
      rough-faced, beetle-browed, hard-featured man, who thought
      beauty and idleness the same thing&mdash;and a parchment skin
      the legitimate complexion for a lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send him to the bar!" said he, "no, no, that will never
      do!&mdash;Send him into the army; he is much too handsome to
      become a lawyer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that's true enough, my lord!" said the mother. So they
      bought Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy a cornetcy in the &mdash;&mdash;
      regiment of dragoons.
    </p>

      Things are not learned by inspiration. Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy
      had never ridden at school, except when he was hoisted; he
      was, therefore, a very indifferent horseman; they sent him to
      the riding-school, and everybody laughed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a d&mdash;d ass!" said Cornet Horsephiz, who was very
      ugly; "a horrid puppy!" said Lieutenant St. Squintem, who was
      still uglier; "if he does not ride better he will disgrace
      the regiment," said Captain Rivalhate, who was very
      good-looking; "if he does not ride better, we will cut him!"
      said Colonel Everdrill, who was a wonderful martinet; "I say,
      Mr. Bumpemwell (to the riding-master,) make that youngster
      ride less like a miller's sack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh, sir, <i>he</i> will never ride better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why the d&mdash;-l will he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless you, colonel, he is a great deal too handsome for a
      cavalry officer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True!" said Cornet Horsephiz.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true," said Lieutenant St. Squintem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must cut him!" said the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy was accordingly cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out hero was a youth of susceptibility&mdash;he quitted the
      &mdash;&mdash; regiment, and challenged the colonel. The
      colonel was killed!
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a terrible blackguard is Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy!" said
      the colonel's relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true!" said the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parents were in despair!&mdash;They were not rich; but
      our hero was an only son, and they sponged hard upon the
      crabbed old uncle! "he is very clever," said they both, "and
      may do yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they borrowed some thousands from the uncle, and bought
      his beautiful nephew a seat in parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy was ambitious, and desirous of
      retrieving his character. He fagged like a
      dragon&mdash;conned pamphlets and reviews&mdash;got Ricardo
      by heart&mdash;and made notes on the English constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a handsome fellow!" whispered one member.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, a coxcomb!" said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never do for a speaker!" said a third, very audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the gentlemen on the opposite benches sneered and
      <i>heard!</i>&mdash;Impudence is only indigenous in Milesia,
      and an orator is not made in a day. Discouraged by his
      reception, Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy grew a little embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Told you so!" said one of his neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fairly broke down!" said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>[pg
      312]</span> "Too fond of his hair to have any thing in his
      head," said a third, who was considered a wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear, hear!" cried the gentlemen on the opposite benches,
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy sat down&mdash;he had not shone; but,
      in justice, he had not failed. Many a first-rate speaker had
      began worse; and many a country member had been declared a
      phoenix of promise upon half his merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so, thought the heroes of corn-laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Adonises never make orators!" said a crack speaker with
      a wry nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor men of business either," added the chairman of a
      committee, with a face like a kangaroo's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor devil!" said the civilest of the set. "He's a deuced
      deal too handsome for a speaker! By Jove, he is going to
      speak again&mdash;this will never do; we must cough him
      down!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy was accordingly coughed down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hero was now seven or eight and twenty, handsomer than
      ever, and the adoration of the young ladies at Almack's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have nothing to leave you," said the parents, who had
      long spent their fortune, and now lived on the credit of
      having once enjoyed it.&mdash;"You are the handsomest man in
      London; you must marry an heiress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," said Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Helen Convolvulus was a charming young lady, with a
      hare-lip and six thousand a-year. To Miss Helen Convolvulus
      then our hero paid his addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavens! what an uproar her relations made about the matter.
      "Easy to see his intentions," said one: "a handsome
      fortune-hunter, who wants to make the best of his
      person!"&mdash;"handsome is that handsome does," says
      another; "he was turned out of the army, and murdered his
      colonel;"&mdash;"never marry a beauty," said a
      third;&mdash;"he can admire none but himself;"&mdash;"will
      have so many mistresses," said a fourth;&mdash;"make you
      perpetually jealous," said a fifth;&mdash;"spend your
      fortune," said a sixth;&mdash;"and break your heart," said a
      seventh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Helen Convolvulus was prudent and wary. She saw a great
      deal of justice in what was said; and was sufficiently
      contented with liberty and six thousand a-year, not to be
      highly impatient for a husband; but our heroine had no
      aversion to a lover; especially to so handsome a lover as Mr.
      Ferdinand Fitzroy. Accordingly she neither accepted nor
      discarded him; but kept him on hope, and suffered him to get
      into debt with his tailor, and his coach-maker. On the
      strength of becoming Mr. Fitzroy Convolvulus. Time went on,
      and excuses and delays were easily found; however, our hero
      was sanguine, and so were his parents. A breakfast at
      Chiswick, and a putrid fever carried off the latter, within
      one week of each other; but not till they had blessed Mr.
      Ferdinand Fitzroy, and rejoiced that they had left him so
      well provided for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, then, our hero depended solely upon the crabbed old
      uncle and Miss Helen Convolvulus; the former, though a
      baronet and a satirist was a banker and a man of
      business:&mdash;he looked very distastefully at the Hyperian
      curls and white teeth of Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I make you my heir," said he&mdash;"I expect you will
      continue the bank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sir!" said the nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" grunted the uncle, "a pretty fellow for a banker!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Debtors grew pressing to Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy, and Mr.
      Ferdinand Fitzroy grew pressing to Miss Helen Convolvulus.
      "It is a dangerous thing," said she, timidly, "to marry a man
      so admired,&mdash;will you always be faithful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By heaven!" cried the lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heigho!" sighed Miss Helen Convolvulus, and Lord Rufus
      Pumilion entering, the conversation was changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the day of the marriage was fixed; and Mr. Ferdinand
      Fitzroy bought a new curricle. By Apollo, how handsome he
      looked in it! A month before the wedding day the uncle died.
      Miss Helen Convolvulus was quite tender in her
      condolences&mdash;"Cheer up, my Ferdinand," said she, "for
      your sake, I have discarded Lord Rufus Pumilion!" "Adorable
      condescension!" cried our hero;&mdash;"but Lord Rufus
      Pumilion is only four feet two, and has hair like a peony."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All men are not so handsome as Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy!" was
      the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away goes our hero, to be present at the opening of his
      uncle's will.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I leave," said the testator (who I have before said was a
      bit of a satirist,) "my share of the bank, and the whole or
      my fortune, legacies excepted, to"&mdash;(here Mr. Ferdinand
      Fitzroy wiped his beautiful eyes with a cambric handkerchief,
      exquisitely <i>brode</i>) "my natural son, John Spriggs, an
      industrious, pains-taking youth, who will do credit to the
      bank. I did once intend to have made my nephew Ferdinand my
      heir; but so curling a head can have no talent for accounts.
      I want my successor to be a man of business, not beauty; and
      Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy is a great deal too handsome for a
      banker; his good looks will, no doubt, win him any heiress in
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>[pg
      313]</span> town. Meanwhile, I leave him, to buy a
      dressing-case, a thousand pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand devils!" said Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy, banging out
      of the room. He flew to his mistress. She was not at home.
      "Lies," says the Italian proverb, "have short legs;" but
      truths, if they are unpleasant, have terrible long ones! The
      next day Mr. Ferdinand Fitzroy received a most obliging note
      of dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you every happiness," said Miss Helen Convolvulus, in
      conclusion&mdash;"but my friends are right; you are much too
      handsome for a husband!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the week after, Miss Helen Convolvulus became Lady Rufus
      Pumilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! sir," said the bailiff, as a day or two after the
      dissolution of parliament, he was jogging along with Mr.
      Ferdinand Fitzroy, in a hackney coach bound to the King's
      Bench,&mdash;"Alas! sir, what a pity it is to take so
      handsome a gentleman to prison!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The MS. found in a Madhouse, by the same author, is perhaps
      too horrific for this terror-loving age; but it is by no
      means less clever on that account; <i>toute en huile</i>
      would not do. Among the other tales are the Rock of the
      Candle, Irish, by the author of Holland-Tide,&mdash;nearly
      forty pages; and the Queen of May and Bridget
      Plantagenet,&mdash;of the olden time&mdash;which would be
      spoiled by abridgment for our present purpose. The same
      reason prevents our giving more than our commendation of Miss
      Mitford's General and his Lady, who, we think are new company
      for our fair authoress.

      In the Vision of Purgatory, by Dr. Maginn, (Irish, of

      The Souvenir is opportunely dedicated to Mr. Peel; and
      whether as a work of art, or elegant literature, it is
      decidedly worthy of such distinguished notice. If the
      argument of the fine arts contributing to virtue hold good,
      then the patronage of a minister will be patriotically
      bestowed on such works as the Literary Souvenir.

      It would be difficult and somewhat egotistical for us to
      describe the pleasure we felt on our receiving this
      interesting volume for notice in our pages. The amiable
      spirit which breathes throughout its pages, and the good
      taste which uniformly dictates its editorship have secured
      the <i>Amulet</i> an extensive, and we are disposed to think,
      a more permanent, popularity than is attached to other works
      of similar form.<a id="footnotetag1"

      The present volume contains Fourteen Plates, among which are
      <i>Murillo's Spanish Flower Girl; Etty's Guardian Angels</i>,
      by Finden; a copy of Sir Thomas Lawrence's portrait of
      <i>Lady Georgiana Fane</i>, from Colnaghi's print; Eastlake's
      <i>Italian Mother;</i> one of Collins's last pictures, <i>The

      There are eighty contributions, as the bookmakers say, "in
      prose and verse," with a predominance of the former. The
      first of the <i>prose</i> is a Strange Story of every day, by
      William Kennedy&mdash;well told, but too long for extract.
      The Mountain Daisy, a village sketch, by the Editor's lady,
      is gracefully written; and with the Fisherman, by the Editor,
      is a fair characteristic of the amiable spirit to which we
      have already alluded; and in the same tone of good feeling is
      the Rose of Fennock Dale, a true story by the fair authoress
      of the Mountain Daisy; and the Wandering Minstrels, by the
      Rev. F.A. Cox, L.L.D. Miss Mitford has contributed one of her
      inimitable sketches, Little Moses; but the most staple
      articles in the volume are The Battle of Bunaania, one of the
      Georgian Islands, by Mr. Ellis, the missionary; Notices of
      the Canadian Indians, by Dr. Walsh; a Journey over the
      Brocken, by Mr. Coleridge; and a Fragment, by Miss Jane

      THE SOUTH SEA CHIEF.
    </h3>
    <center>
      <i>By Miss Jane Porter</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      While in the north of Europe, I met with a rather
      extraordinary person, whose account of himself might afford a
      subject for a pretty romance; a sort of new Paul and
      Virginia; but with what different catastrophe, it is not fair
      to presage. He described himself as a Frenchman, a native of
      Bourdeaux; where, at an early age, he was put on board a
      merchant ship, to learn the profession of a seaman. About
      that time war broke out between Great Britain, and the lately
      proclaimed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page314"
      name="page314"></a>[pg 314]</span> Republic of France; and
      the vessel he was in, being attacked, and taken by an English
      man-of-war, he was carried a prisoner into England. When
      there, his naturally enterprising character would not submit
      itself to a state of captivity; and, soon making his wishes
      understood, he entered on board a British sloop, bound to New
      Holland. While gazing with rapt astonishment on the seeming
      new heavens which canopied that, to him, also, new portion of
      the globe; while the stars of the Cross were exciting his
      youthful wonder; and he could no where find the
      constellations of the Great, or Little Bear in the midnight
      firmament, the sky was suddenly overcast with a cloud, like
      the pall of nature, and a fearful tempest burst from it. The
      scene was dreadful on that wide waste of waters; and the
      vessel being driven at last into the rocky labyrinths of the
      Society Isles, was finally wrecked on one not many leagues
      from the celebrated Otaheite. Laonce, the young Frenchman,
      and one seaman of the sloop, an honest north Briton, were the
      only persons who escaped; for when morning broke, they found
      themselves, restored from insensibility, lying on the shore,
      and not a trace of the ship, or of those who had navigated
      her, was to be discerned. The inhabitants of the island,
      apparently wild savages by their almost naked state, instead
      of seizing them as a prey, took them to their huts, fed, and
      cherished them. Hope for awhile flattered them that some
      other vessel, bound for New Holland, might also be driven
      upon those islands, though not with the same hard fate, and
      that by her means they might be released, and conveyed back
      to Europe. But days, and weeks, and months, wearing away
      without any such arrival, they began to regard the
      expectation less, and to turn their minds to take a more
      intimate interest in objects around them. Time, indeed,
      accustomed them to what might be called barbarous, in the
      manners of the people; by degrees, even themselves laid aside
      their European habits; they exchanged their clothing for the
      half-exposed fashion of the native chiefs; and, adopting
      their pursuits and pleasures, became hunters, and bold
      fishers in the light canoe. Finally, they learnt to speak the
      language, as if they had been born in the island; and, at
      length, sealed their insular destiny by marrying native
      women. Laonce was hardly eighteen when he was first cast
      ashore amongst them; but having a handsome person, and those
      engaging manners, from a naturally amiable disposition added
      to a gentleman's breeding, which never fail agreeably
      impressing even the rudest minds, the eye of female
      tenderness soon found him out; and the maiden, being the
      daughter of the king, and beautiful withal, had only to hint
      her wishes to her royal sire; and the king naming them to
      their distinguished object, she immediately became his happy
      bride. Laonce, becoming thus royally allied, and in the line
      of the throne, instantly received publicly the investiture of
      the highest order of Otaheitan nobility, namely, a species of
      tattooing appropriated to chiefs alone. The limbs of the body
      thus distinguished, are traversed all over with a damasked
      sort of pattern, while the particular royal insignia is
      marked on the left side of the forehead, and below the eye,
      like a thick mass of dark tattooing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the young Frenchman, and his north Briton companion, had
      reserved to themselves means of increasing their consequence,
      still more than by their mere personal merits, with their new
      fellow-countrymen. A few days after the wreck, the subsiding
      elements had cast up certain articles of the ship, which they
      managed to turn to good account: the most valuable of them
      were fire-arms and some gunpowder, and a few other
      implements, both of defence, and use in household, or ship's
      repairs. The fire-arms seemed to endow the new young chief,
      just engrafted into the reigning stock, with a kind of
      preternatural authority; and, by the aid of his old messmate,
      and new bosom-coadjutor, he exerted all his influence over
      their awed minds, to prevent their recurrence to the
      frightful practice he had seen on his first landing, of
      devouring the prisoners they took in war. His marriage had
      invested him with the power of a natively born son of the
      king; and, having made himself master of their language, his
      persuasions were so conclusive with the leading warriors,
      that, in the course of a very little time, it was rare to
      hear that so dreadful a species of vengeance was ever tasted,
      even in stealth. However, so addicted were some few of the
      fiercer sort, to this ancient triumph of their ancestors,
      that he found it necessary to add commands to persuasions,
      and then threats to commands; and having expressed in the
      strongest terms his abhorrence of so cowardly and brutal a
      practice, he told them, that the first man he saw attempt to
      touch the flesh of a prisoner to devour it, he would
      instantly put the offender to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after this warning, a fray took place between the
      natives of his father-in-law's dominions, and their enemies
      from a hostile island. A number of captives were taken; and
      all under his command held his former orders in such
      reverence, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page315"
      name="page315"></a>[pg 315]</span> that none, excepting two
      (and they had before shown refractory dispositions,) presumed
      to disobey his edict of mercy. But these men, in derision of
      his lenity, particularly to the female sex, selected a woman
      prisoner to be their victim; and slaying her, as they would
      have done a beast, they commenced their horrible repast upon
      her body. Laonce descried the scene at a distance just as
      they had prepared their hideous banquet, and, going
      resolutely towards them, levelled his musket at the
      cannibals. One of the wretches was killed with the horrid
      morsel in his mouth, and a second shot, brought down his
      voracious accomplice in the act. This bold example so awed
      all within ken of the fact, that from that hour, until the
      day he quitted the island, a period of fourteen years, no
      captive ever met with the interdicted fate. Though the old
      sovereign continued in life, he consigned the power to his
      new son, and Laonce became virtually king of the place.
      Indeed, so reconciled was he and his friend the north Briton
      (who also married) to the spot which had first sheltered
      them, and then adopted them even as its legitimate offspring,
      that although many ships of different nations touched there,
      no inducements could prevail on them to quit their sea-girt
      home of simple nature, for all the blandishments which
      civilized life could produce. Yet Laonce took a hospitable
      delight in showing every act of friendship in his power to
      the captains of the vessels; refitting them with food and
      fresh water; and rendering them much essential service, in
      pointing out how to manage with safety the difficult
      navigation round the several islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animation with which he recited these circumstances,
      after he was far from the spot where they took place,
      strongly portrayed the fearless independence of his former
      life. He spoke with the decision of one whose commands had
      been unappealable, and all the barbarian chief lightened in
      his eyes. But when he recalled his home there, his family
      happiness, his countenance fell, his eyes clouded, and he
      spoke in half-stifled words. He described his palace-hut; his
      arms, his hunting spear, his canoe; his return to his hut,
      with the fruits of the chase; the graceful, delicate person
      of his wife; her clinging fondness on his entrance; his
      tenderness for her, and for his children&mdash;for she bore
      to him a son and a daughter; and, while he spoke, he burst
      into tears, and sobbed like a child. "I was then beloved,"
      said he, "Honoured!&mdash;master of all around me; Now, I am
      nothing:&mdash;no home&mdash;no wife&mdash;no friend! I am an
      outcast here!&mdash;when there! Oh, Berea! wilt thou have
      forgotten me?" His tears, and wild agonies, prevented him
      proceeding; and my eyes could not remain dry, when seeing
      such genuine grief, such real suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cause of his being separated from his South-Sea home,
      and his beloved Berea and her babes, remains to be told. It
      appears, that about three years before the period I met him,
      a Russian ship, sent on a voyage of discoveries, touched at
      the island where Laonce had become naturalized. The captain
      was received with royal hospitality by the king; and the
      <i>Prince Laonce</i> became the glad interpreter between the
      Europeans and his august father-in-law&mdash;for the captain
      spoke French. And, besides procuring the crew all they wanted
      for common comforts, the young chief loaded the commander and
      his officers with useful presents. One night it blew a
      violent gale, and the Russian captain, deeming it impossible
      to keep his anchorage in a bay so full of unseen dangers,
      made signals to the land, in hopes of exciting some native,
      experienced in the navigation, to come off, and direct him
      how to steer. Every moment increased his jeopardy; the storm
      augmented; and, at each growing blast, he expected to be torn
      from his cables, and dashed to atoms against the rocks. No
      one moved from the shore. Again the signals were repeated:
      Laonce had risen from his bed on hearing the first. Who was
      there amongst all in that island, excepting his British
      comrade, who would have known how to move <i>a ship</i>
      through those boiling waves? The light canoe, and a vessel of
      heavy burthen, were different objects! His comrade was then
      watching by the side of an almost dying wife, who had just
      made him the father of his first-born son. Could Laonce
      summon him from that spot of his heart's tenderest duties, to
      attend to the roaring guns of distress from a stranger
      vessel? Impossible! He rose, and looked out on the night. He
      listened to the second signal, he wrung his hands, and,
      sighing, was returning to his couch again. His wife had then
      risen also. She clasped her arms round him, and a big tear
      stood in both her eyes, "You tell me," said she, "that your
      people do not make those thunders to heaven, and to earth,
      till they are drowning. You know you can save them all. Go,
      Lao,"&mdash;and she smiled; "go; and the foreign chief, after
      you have saved him, will give you something for
      me&mdash;either a looking-glass, or a silk handkerchief. Go,
      Lao."
    </p>
    <p>
      He wound his arms round the gentle pleader; and, almost
      ashamed that the father and the husband in his heart,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>[pg
      316]</span> should make him calculate between his own life
      and that of the gallant crew, he told her, that the tempest
      raged too tremendously for him to dare stemming it. But she
      laughingly repulsed his caresses, accusing his fondness for
      her as the inducement of his assumed apprehensions; and being
      too long accustomed to the rashness of her own people, in
      braving every weather, to believe any plea of positive
      danger, she still persisted; saying she must have a silk
      handkerchief that night from yon ship, or she should think he
      loved his sound sleep better than he did his fond Berea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enthusiastic love which still warmed the faithful
      husband's breast, and a third signal of distress from the
      struggling vessel, mastered his better judgment, and, seizing
      his canoe, he dashed into the foaming waves and boldly
      stemmed their fury to the object of his mission. The
      overjoyed crew, as they heard his voice hailing them through
      the storm, cast out a rope, by which they hoisted him into
      their cracking ship. The most rapturous acknowledgments from
      the captain, greeted him as soon as he jumped on the deck;
      and the eager seamen called him their deliverer. He was
      happy! he said, he was happy in the achievement of what he
      had done; he had obeyed the wish of his beloved Berea, and he
      had survived the lashing surge. He was happy, in the
      confidence that he should rescue the gallant vessel he came
      to take under his control. But that hour of happiness was his
      last. He took the helm in his hands; he gave the requisite
      directions to the seamen, for the management of the ship; and
      he soon steered her out of the dangers of the bay, till she
      rode in safety on the main ocean. He then asked for a boat to
      carry him on shore, for his canoe had been crushed by an
      accident. But the wind still blowing hurricanes, they would
      not venture the loss of one of their boats: and during the
      hot contentions between him, and the ungrateful chief of the
      vessel he had preserved, they were driven out far to sea;
      whence his swimming arm, had he plunged into the boisterous
      deep, could have been of no use to him. Indignation, despair,
      overwhelmed him. None appeared to understand the nature of
      his feelings; all pretending to wonder that a European born,
      should not be grateful to any occasion that would carry him
      away from a savage country like that. In vain Laonce
      remonstrated; in vain he talked of his wife and children; the
      captain and his sailors laughed, promised him better of both
      sorts among his kindred whites; and when he cursed their
      hardened hearts and cruel treachery, they laughed again, and
      left him to his misery. At last, when the protracted
      hurricane subsided, and the vessel's log-book proved that she
      had been driven several degrees leeward of the Society Isles,
      abandoned to a sullen despair, he ceased to accuse or to
      reproach; he ceased even to speak on any subject, but cast
      himself into his lonely berth during the day, that he might
      not be irritated to continued unavailing madness, by the
      sight of the ingrates who had betrayed him. To his straining
      eyes, nothing but the silvery line of the starlit sea was on
      that distant horizon; but his heart's vision pierced farther,
      and he beheld the sleepers in that home;&mdash;no, not the
      sleepers! His disconsolate, his despairing wife, tearing her
      bright locks, and beating the tender bosom he must no longer
      clasp to his own. His children&mdash;"Oh! my babes!" cried
      he, and the cry of a father's heart for once pierced the
      obdurate bosom of the captain, who, in that moment, had
      happened to come upon the deck to examine the night. To ease
      his Otaheitan benefactor, he declared he had thus carried him
      off, to share in the honour of his expected discoveries. The
      unhappy chief, in then answering him, begged, that if he had,
      indeed, any spark of honesty towards him, he would prove it,
      by obeying his wish in one thing at least; and that was, to
      set him on shore on the first European settlement they should
      fall in with. "Do this," said he, "and I may yet believe you
      have honour. For honour is a man's own act; a discovery is
      fortune's; and for its advantages, did I stay, I should not
      have to thank you. But I want none such. Set me on shore, and
      there I will follow my own destiny."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this poor request, the iron-souled commander of the
      vessel, at last consented; and in the course of some weeks
      after, Laonce was landed on the coast of Kamschatka. His
      secret intent was to lie in wait for the possibility of some
      ship touching at the port where he was set ashore, that might
      be bound to the track of his beloved islands; but not
      uttering a word of this, to the reprobate wretch who had torn
      him thence, he simply bade him "farewell! and to use his next
      pilot better;" so saying, they parted for ever. But weeks and
      months passed away, and no vessel bound for the South Seas,
      showed itself in that distant latitude; and its gloomy fogs,
      and chilling atmosphere, its pale sky, where the sun never
      shone for more than three or four hours in the day, seemed to
      wither up his life with his waning hopes! In no way did it
      resemble the land he had left;
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317"></a>[pg
      317]</span> the warm, and the genial heavens of the home he
      was yet bent to find again;&mdash;and he left Kamschatka for
      some more propitious port; but, like <i>Sinbad the
      Sailor</i>, he wandered in vain. A cruel spell seemed set on
      him, or on the spirit of adventure; for in no place could he
      hear of a vessel going the way of his prayers. At last he
      arrived, by a most tedious and circuitous journey at Moscow,
      with a design to lay his case before the young and ardent
      Alexander, the then Emperor of Russia; with the hope that his
      benevolence, and a sense of what he had done for the vessel
      which had betrayed him, would incline his majesty to make
      some effort to return him to his island, and his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this hope was not vain, the character of the good
      Alexander, since proved by a life of undeviating promptness
      to all acts of humanity, may be a sufficient voucher. But
      whether the homeward-bound chief, found, on his setting his
      foot again upon the ground whence he had been so cruelly
      rifled; and whence, indeed, the innocent confidence, the
      playful bravery of his fond wife, had urged him; whether he
      found his cherishly-remembered home, yet standing as he left
      it; and her, still the tender and the true to his
      never-wandered heart; and whether his children sprang to his
      knee, to share the parental caress; and the people around,
      raised the <i>haloo</i> of joy to the returned <i>son of
      their king!</i>&mdash;whether these fondly-expected greetings
      hailed his arrival, cannot be absolutely told; for the vessel
      that took him out, was to make the circuit of the globe, ere
      it returned; hence, from that, and other circumstances, the
      facts have never reached the narrator of this little history,
      of what was really the meeting between Laonce and his Berea;
      of the young chief, and the natives he had devotedly served!
      But can the faithful hearts of wedded love, doubt the one; or
      manly attachment suspect the other? For the honour of human
      nature, we will believe that all was right; and, in the faith
      of a humble Christian, we will believe, that "he who shewed
      mercy, found mercy!"; That he is now restored to his
      island-home, and to his happy, grateful family!

      We congratulate the editor and the public on the past success
      of the <i>Amulet</i>, especially as it proves that a pious
      feeling co-exists with a taste for refined amusement, and
      that advantageously. There is nothing austere in any page of
      the <i>Amulet</i>, nor anything so frivolous and light as to
      be objectionable; but it steers in the medium, and
      consequently must be acceptable to every well-regulated mind.
      Indeed, many of the pieces in the present volume may be read
      and re-read with increased advantage; whilst two only are
      unequal to the names attached to them.

      THE GEM.
    </h3>
    <center>
      <i>Edited by Thomas Hood, Esq.</i>
    </center>
    <p>
      The present is the first year of the <i>Gem</i>, which, as a
      work of art or literature, fully comes within the import of
      its title. It is likewise the first appearance of Mr. Hood as
      the editor of an "annual," who, with becoming diffidence,
      appears to rely on the "literary giants" of his muster-roll,
      rather than on his individual talent. Notwithstanding such an
      editorship must have resembled the perplexity of Sinbad in
      the Valley of Diamonds, Mr. Hood's volume is almost
      unexceptionably good, whatever he may have rejected; and one
      of the best, if not <i>the best</i>, article in the whole
      work, has been contributed by the editor himself. Associated
      as Mr. Hood's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page318"
      name="page318"></a>[pg 318]</span> name is with "whim and
      oddity," we, however, looked for more quips, quirks, and
      quiddities than he has given us, which we should have hailed
      as specially suited to the approaching festive season, and
      from their contrast with the contents of similar works, as
      more likely to attract by their novelty and humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The embellishments of the <i>Gem</i>, fifteen in number, have
      been selected by A. Cooper, Esq. R.A. <i>The Death of
      Keeldar</i> is a beautiful composition by Mr. Cooper, and is
      worthy of association with Sir Walter Scott's pathetic
      ballad. <i>The Widow</i>, by S. Davenport, from a picture by
      R. Leslie, R.A. is one of the most touching prints we have
      yet seen, and every one is capable of estimating its
      beauties, since its expression will be sure to fasten on the
      affections of the beholder. <i>May Talbot</i>, by J.C.
      Edwards, from a painting by A. Cooper, is admirable in design
      and execution. Of the <i>Temptation on the Mount</i>,
      engraved by W.R. Smith, after Martin, we have spoken in our
      accompanying Number; but as often as we look at the plate, we
      discover new beauties. It is a just idea of "all the kingdoms
      of the earth;" the distant effect is excellent, and the
      "exceeding high mountain" is ably represented. The faces in
      the <i>Painter's Study</i> are decidedly superior to the rest
      of the print. The <i>Fisherman's Daughter</i>, from a
      painting by Bone, is pleasing; and <i>Venice, with the
      Embarkation of the Doge</i>, is a stirring scene of pageantry
      and triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the <i>poetry</i> is the Painter's Song, a pleasing
      composition, by Barry Cornwall, who has also The Victim, a
      dramatic sketch of twenty pages. Stanzas by Horace Smith,
      Esq. are a pleasant satire upon the little vanities of great
      people. We give the <i>Dream of Eugene Aram</i> in full,
      although it consists of nearly two pages of small
      type.:&mdash;

      THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.

      Mr. Planch&eacute;'s versification of the homely
      proverb&mdash;Poverty parts good company&mdash;will create
      many good-natured smiles, and run counter with Mr. Kenney's
      To-morrow. Some of the minor pieces are very pleasing,
      especially two by Hartley Coleridge, Esq.

    <p>
      We confess we do not admire the taste which dictated Mr. C.
      Lamb's Widow; it is in every respect unworthy of the plate,
      and the feelings created by the two are very discordant. We
      love a joke, but to call a widow's sables a perpetual "black
      joke," disgusts rather than pleases us. The Funeral of
      General Crawford, by the author of The Subaltern is an
      affecting incident; and Nina St. Morin, by the author of May
      You Like It, is of the same character. Catching a Tartar, by
      Mansie Wauch, and the Station, an Irish Story, are full of
      humour; and May Day, by the editor, abounds with oddities.
      Thus, "the golden age is not to be regilt; pastoral is gone
      out, and Pan extinct&mdash;pans will not last for ever;"
      "horticultural hose, <i>pruned</i> so often at top to
      <i>graft</i> at bottom, that from long stockings they had
      dwindled into short socks;" "the contrast of a large marquee
      in canvass with the long lawn;" "Pan's sister, Patty, the
      wags called <i>Patty Pan</i>," &amp;c.
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320"></a>[pg
      320]</span> One of the finest stories in the <i>Gem</i> is
      the Rival Dreamers, by Mr. Banim; and curious enough, this is
      the third Annual in which we have met with the same legend.
      The present version is, however, the best narrative, which
      such of our readers as know the O'Hara Family will readily
      believe. We could abridge it for our present space; but it
      would be injustice to the author to pare down his beautiful
      descriptions; and we will endeavour to give place to the tale
      in a future Number. The Last Embarkation of the Doge of
      Venice is interesting; almost every incident connected with
      that huge pleasure-house is attractive, but one of the
      present, the Marriage of the Sea, is well told. The
      Shearmen's Miracle Play smacks pleasantly of "the good old
      times" of merry England. Miss Mitford has contributed two of
      her inimitable sketches&mdash;Harry Lewington and his Dog,
      and Tom Hopkins&mdash;the latter an excellent portrait of
      "the loudest, if not the greatest man" in the little town of
      Cranley. We must give the village lion, in little:&mdash;

    <h3>
      TOM HOPKINS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the time of which I speak, Tom Hopkins was of an age
      somewhat equivocal; public fame called him fifty, whilst he
      himself stuck obstinately at thirty-five; of a stout active
      figure, rather manly than gentlemanly, and a bold, jovial
      visage, in excellent keeping with his person, distinguished
      by round, bright, stupid black eyes, an aquiline nose, a
      knowing smile, and a general comely vulgarity of aspect. His
      voice was hoarse and deep, his manner bluff and blunt, and
      his conversation loud and boisterous. With all these natural
      impediments to good company, the lowness of his origin,
      recent in their memories, and the flagrant fact of his
      residence in a country town, staring them in the face, Mr.
      Tom Hopkins made his way into almost every family of
      consideration in the neighbourhood. Sportsmanship, sheer
      sportsmanship, the qualification that, more than any other,
      commands the respect of your great English landholder,
      surmounted every obstacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the ladies, he made his way by different qualities; in
      the first place he was a character, an oddity, and the
      audacity of his vulgarity was tolerated, where a man only
      half as boisterous would have been scouted; then he was
      gallant in his way, affected, perhaps felt, a great devotion
      to the sex, and they were half amused, half pleased, with the
      rough flattery which seemed, and probably was, so sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      His house was an ugly brick dwelling of his own erection,
      situate in the principal street of Cranley, and adorned with
      a green door and a brass knocker, giving entrance into a
      stone passage, which, there being no other way to the stable,
      served both for himself, and that very dear part of himself,
      his horses, whose dwelling was certainly by far more
      commodious than their master's. His accommodations were
      simple enough. The dining-parlour, which might pass for his
      only sitting-room,&mdash;for the little dark den which he
      called his drawing-room was not entered three times a year;
      the dining-room was a small square room, coloured pea-green
      with a gold moulding, adorned with a series of four prints on
      shooting, and four on hunting, together with two or three
      portraits of eminent racers, riders, hunters, and grooms.
      Guns and fishing-rods were suspended over the mantelpiece;
      powder-horns, shot-belts, and game-bags scattered about; a
      choice collection of flies for angling lay in one corner,
      whips and bridles in another, and a pile of books and
      papers,&mdash;Colonel Thornton's Tour, Daniel's Rural Sports,
      and a heap of Racing Calendars, occupied a third; Ponto and
      Carlo lay basking on the hearth-rug, and a famous little
      cocking spaniel, Flora by name, a conscious favourite, was
      generally stretched in state on an arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, except when the owner was absent on a sporting
      expedition, which, between fishing, shooting, hunting, and
      racing, did, it must be confessed, happen pretty often; here
      his friends were sure to find a hearty welcome, a good
      beef-steak,&mdash;his old housekeeper was famous for
      cookery!&mdash;and as much excellent Port and super-excellent
      Madeira&mdash;Tom, like most of his school, eschewed claret
      and other thin potations&mdash;as their host could prevail on
      them to swallow. Many a good fellow hath heard the chimes at
      midnight in this little room.

      In the present sheet we are only able to include Notices of
      <i>four</i> of the <i>nine</i> Annuals, exclusive of the
      <i>Juvenile Presents</i>, which we reserve for a "select
      party." Our notice of the <i>Winter's Wreath</i> is in type,
      but must stand over for the present, as well as those of the
      <i>Keepsake, Anniversary, Bijou</i>, and <i>Friendship's
      Offering</i>, which will freight another Supplementary Sheet,
      to follow very shortly. We prefer this method to passing over
      the merits of these works with mere commendatory
      generalities. It does not require a microscopic or a critical
      eye to distinguish their beauties; but we hope the means we
      have adopted for the present gratification of our readers
      will be such as to induce them to look for the appearance of
      our SECOND SUPPLEMENT, as well as to prove ourselves worthy
      of the <i>encore</i>. Like some comic singers, we will
      endeavour to keep up the entertainment by "variations."

        which soothes and tranquillizes the soul." We are not
        suiting the action to the word; on the contrary, we would

        enjoins&mdash;in our "heart of hearts," as well in
        returning health and vigour as in the above moments.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
